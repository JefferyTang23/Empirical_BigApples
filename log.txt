- Worked on a plan on gathering empirical data for binary search and linear search.
- We discussed where we would place our timestamps to get the most accurate data.
- We also talked about using different array sizes

12/16/2021 --- 7 pm EST

- Worked more on the plan.
- We discussed how different computers ran at different speeds.

12/17/2021 --- 12 pm EST

- Looked over plan reviews and plan to incorporate randomness in our testing.

- We created a test that tested if linear search or binary search is faster when the target is an element of lower index.
- We took the average speed of linear search and binary search finding a lower index in an array of size 1000000. To our surprise, binary search was faster.
- We took the average speed of linear search and binary search finding a higher index in an array of size 1000000. Not to our surprise, binary search was faster.

12/20/21 --- 12 pm EST

- Did tests with looking through every index for both linear and binary search of size 10000000 and size 500000, and index of 10000 and 20000. Binary search was significantly faster.
