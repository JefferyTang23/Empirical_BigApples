L03 - Binary vs Linear
2021-12-16
time spent:  0.5 hours

DISCO
- currentTimeMillis() gives the current time in miliseconds
- We had to increase repetition to increase the amount of time that the code took to run. 
QCC
- Are there other time stamp methods that give time in other units of time?
- What run times should we be getting?
- What are some potential errors from currentTimeMillis()?
GALLERY TOUR
- We could have used plots/graphs/tables to make our data easier to read.
- We could have also used best/worst case scenarios.
- Binary search is always faster after a certain threshold.
